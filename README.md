# SecurePaw(Pet Adoption Platform)

## Description

The Pet Adoption Platform is a user-friendly web-based application designed to streamline the adoption process for pets. Our platform aims to connect individuals with regional animal shelters and rescue groups, making it simple and convenient to find and adopt pets in need of loving homes. 

### Objectives

- Boost responsible pet ownership
- Stimulate pet adoption
- Improve animal welfare
- Acknowledge the positive impact of pet ownership on mental health and community well-being

According to the American Psychiatric Association, "Among pet owners, a strong majority (86%) said their pets have a mostly positive impact on their mental health" (American Psychiatric Association, 2023). Our platform seeks to leverage this benefit by providing visibility into available pets and facilitating the adoption process.
